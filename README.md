# test_vscode
This is a repository for IB9JHO to test you can compile and run C/C++ in the correct enviroment with vscode.

# Setting up the Environment

The easiest way to get straight to programming is to create/open a codespace in the cloud and selecting the GCC compiler
when prompted. 
You can do this with:

+ Github directly
![codespace](https://github.com/Aurashk/test_vscode/assets/9390150/3e4bd62e-12dc-4cd6-a924-34e7c5acef85)

+ Vscode installed on your device
![codespace_in_vscode](https://github.com/Aurashk/test_vscode/assets/9390150/61e950e5-237c-40c1-8062-e62d7f535b59)

A local enviroment on your device is faster, not limited on computing resources, and available offline. 
If you want to set this up follow the [instructions here](https://github.com/Aurashk/test_vscode/files/12751241/Configuring.vscode.for.local.use.pdf)

Test that your environment is working by compiling and running the C code in this repository found in src/main.c.

Click the play button highlighted in yellow to compile and run. You should see the program output from the print
statement in our code as highlighted in orange. 

# Testing
Assignments are marked automatically using tests. You can run the tests in vscode by going to the tests tab and clicking the play button.

The tests are failing because the output of our program is not what we expect it to be. The correct output can be found in tests/IO/correct_output.txt
Modify the code output is correct and rerun the tests to verify that the output of the program is correct.
